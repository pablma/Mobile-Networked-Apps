Guide:
We have made the Part 1 using the localhost server in WAMP.
To run the program correctly you need to have the .php files in the www folder of wamp.
Then, you have to create a new database called mandatory3_database in your localhost server
and add 1 table.
The table is called 'users' and must have 3 columns, 'user_id', 'Username', 'Password'.
If you complete all the steps the program should work correctly.

Note: if you are using another client like XAMP, you have to edit the php scripts because the fields
'username' and 'password' has another parameters.
Example:
(WAMP: Username = "root"     Password = "")
(XAMP: Username = "root"     Password = "1234")
